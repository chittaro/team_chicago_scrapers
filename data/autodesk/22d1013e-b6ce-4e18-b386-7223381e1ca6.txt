Alliance Offers Plant Design Teams Enhanced Drafting and Documentation Capabilities in Multiple Areas
SAN RAFAEL, Calif. and CAMBRIDGE, England, Oct 14, 2003 /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX/ -- -- Autodesk, Inc. (Nasdaq: ADSK), the world's leading digital, 3D software
company, and AVEVA (LSE: AVV), the leading supplier of engineering IT systems
for the offshore, process and energy industries, today announced a strategic
alliance. The alliance brings together AVEVA's leading data-centric plant
design management expertise with the superior drafting and documentation
capabilities of AutoCAD(R) 2004 software to create extended solutions for
larger process plant engineering teams.  This new solution will offer an
excellent migration path and clear future for users of leading legacy plant
design systems.

The alliance integrates AVEVA's VANTAGE Plant Design Management System
(PDMS) and AutoCAD 2004, Autodesk's 2D drafting, detailing, and design tool
and flagship product.  The combined capabilities will enhance PDMS's automated
deliverable production with versatile post-processing, enhanced management,
and accelerated delivery of design documentation, ultimately eliminating
errors and reducing the time to plant start-up.
"AVEVA has been a supplier of engineering systems to AMEC for more than
20 years and Autodesk products have been widely used in our engineering
capabilities," said Steve Trench, manager of engineering for AMEC Group Ltd
Downstream Business, a leading international engineering services company.
"Bringing together the PDMS 3D design system and AutoCAD design software will
help us to improve the quality of our product deliverables for our clients,
through increased productivity and flexibility."
PDMS offers advanced, automated drawing production from a plant data model
in all leading industry drafting formats.  Using the AutoCAD 2004 product's
powerful detailing, annotation, sharing, and document management capabilities,
AVEVA will offer intelligent, AutoCAD-enhanced deliverables with tight
integration to the plant data model.  Other PDMS output formats will be
unaffected.  Autodesk is providing AVEVA with consulting, training, and
support through Autodesk Professional Services.
In addition, schematic design will be enhanced by adding the superior
drafting capabilities of AutoCAD 2004 to AVEVA's intelligent P&ID application.
AVEVA has extensive engineering domain experience in integrated 2D and 3D
workflow management, therefore the joint agreement will be able to offer
significant productivity increases in this fundamental area.
In addition, the joint development agreement offers the potential for
Autodesk and AVEVA to jointly develop integration of PDMS with Autodesk(R)
Architectural Desktop and Autodesk Inventor(R) software products to meet the
needs of enclosed process plant facilities for use by bio-pharmaceutical
companies, as well as tying together the overall plant design process to the
design of specialized process plant equipment and machinery.
Integrating for Increased Productivity
The process plant and power design software market is the third largest
design software market in the world with annual sales of software and services
forecasted at $479 million worldwide in 2003, according to Daratech, Inc.
AVEVA and Autodesk will work closely together in development, marketing, and
sales to bring this combination of best of breed technologies to this market.
"This is a monumental event for the process plant engineering IT industry
as a whole," said Richard Longdon, CEO, AVEVA Group.  "As the leaders in
data-centric plant design technology, we are extremely excited about an
alliance with the leaders in drawing-centric design technology.  The
cooperation between the best of each world brings a new level of productivity
to every aspect of the plant design industry.  We look forward to sharing this
productivity with our customers."
"Autodesk is committed to rounding out its solution offerings in the
process and energy industries," said John Sanders, vice president of
Autodesk's Platform Technology Division.  "Together with AVEVA, we are able to
expand our reach, offering a complete design solution for medium and large
process plant engineering and distributed design teams who are working on
complex projects."
About PDMS
VANTAGE Plant Design Management System (PDMS) is a data centric,
multi-disciplinary solution for 3D process plant design featuring applications
and reference data for every engineering discipline.  It differs from the
conventional 3D design approach in not requiring a drawing engine, but
producing graphics from a single, coherent data model of the entire plant.
First launched in 1976, PDMS's architecture was designed to evolve.  It has
been delivered on many leading operating systems -- the current release
represents the very latest design and business technology and complete
compatibility with previous versions.
