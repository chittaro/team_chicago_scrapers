      sectors such as Infrastructure, Construction, Power, Steel Metals &

      years.

      Modeling (BIM) Solutions
offered by the
Autodesk
Building
      Design Suite
,
Infrastructure

and

,
Asia Pacific
,
Americas
,
Europe
and
India
, through joint business development and engineering consultancy
      services.
The adoption of BIM has seen significant increase
      worldwide in areas of building, infrastructure and construction
      management. According to 2012 McGraw Hill North America BIM SmartMarket
      Report, the percentage of companies using BIM jumped from 17% in 2007 to
      71% in 2012 in
North America
. In the
UK
, BIM is a central theme in the
      government’s construction strategy designed to reduce carbon and costs
      as part of the overall economic development. In
Singapore
, BIM is an
      important component of public housing projects.
Commenting on the announcement,
Mr.
J.P. Haran
, Managing Director,
Tata Consulting Engineers Ltd
,
said, “
Tata Consulting Engineers
      is present in key industry sectors managing projects that are complex
      and large scale, especially in building, town planning and
      infrastructure. We are committed to providing responsible consulting
      solutions to our customers that are sustainable, smart and cost
      efficient. This partnership with
Autodesk
will help
Tata Consulting
Engineers add value by implementing BIM solutions in the building,
      infrastructure and plant solution space.
Providing
      technology-enabled solutions also complements our larger strategic goals
      in spreading our business in the global markets.”
Mr.
Pradeep Nair
, Managing Director, Autodesk India & SAARC,
said,
“
Globally, one of the most significant technology trends
      today is the adoption of
Building Information Modeling
(BIM). BIM goes
      well beyond traditional CAD software that is popular in most developing
      countries. India’s 12th five-year Plan envisages infrastructure
      investments of
$1 trillion
.
BIM will help us derive cost and time
      savings in such mega-projects, while ensuring sustainability. As the
      leading provider of BIM solutions we are delighted to partner with Tata
      Consulting Engineers to promote the adoption of BIM in
India
and other
      emerging markets.”
