Hi. My boss is looking to purchase a licence for the AEC Collection. I have called all of the partner companies listed on the Autodesk-Partner website for
resellers
in the Caribbean region, and none of them are licensed to sell to Caribbean countries. Can my boss buy the software directly from the Autodesk website? Can I please get some direction as to where we can purchase the licence?
Thank you.
Solved!

Hi
@mstclair1952
Thanks for your interest in AEC Collection! Autodesk Online Store is not available in Caribbean countries at the moment, so you will need to purchase through Autodesk authorized resellers in your country. Just to clarify, which country are you located? Did you search the resellers on our
Partner Locator
?

We are in Saint Lucia. Yes I have called and sent messages to all of the partners listed on the Autodesk - Partners website through the partner locator and none of them sell to the Caribbean countries. Can you please give me guidance as to which other partners that are within the vicinity of the Caribbean or located in the Caribbean and actually sell product licences to Caribbean countries? Your advice will be greatly appreciated. Thanking you in advance.

Good day. I am located in Grenada and I am struggling with the same problem. I need to purchase the software but cannot find a single distributor for the Caribbean region. Please help. We require the software urgently.
