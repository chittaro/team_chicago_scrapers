EdgeCAM Software Fully Supports Autodesk's Industry-Leading 3D Mechanical                              Design Software
SOUTHFIELD, Mich., March 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Marking its
nine-year alliance with Autodesk, Inc. (Nasdaq: ADSK), Pathtrace today
announced that EdgeCAM Version 9.5 fully supports Autodesk Inventor(R) 10
mechanical design software and provides true data integrity and
model-to-toolpath associativity.  The newest version of EdgeCAM from
Pathtrace, Autodesk's Global Preferred CAM Partner, introduces new
functionality and ease-of-use, including loading native Autodesk Inventor
assemblies (*.iam) directly into EdgeCAM.
As an Autodesk Global Preferred CAM Partner, Pathtrace and Autodesk
development teams work closely to ensure the highest level of interoperability
between EdgeCAM and Autodesk Inventor software.  EdgeCAM Solid Machinist
respects project paths and sub-assemblies and complies with Autodesk data
management rules.  The partnership between Autodesk and Pathtrace provides
joint customers with a complete design, data management and CAM solution to
reduce manufacturing time, cut costs while reducing scrap, and increase
profitable machine time.
Steve Sivitter, CEO for Pathtrace, said, "By integrating our software with
the latest release of Autodesk Inventor, we are offering customers a fully
associative CAM solution that addresses the major manufacturing disciplines,
and enables them to bring their products to market faster."
The CAM standard in intelligent solids-based manufacturing, EdgeCAM offers
superior integration, associativity and machining functionality to any other
system currently available.
"Autodesk's partnership with Pathtrace is important to our commitment to
help customers create, manage and share design and product data to realize
ideas and get the right designs done more quickly," said Robert Kross, vice
president of Autodesk's Manufacturing Solutions Division.  "Our applications'
interoperability further enhances Autodesk Inventor functional design
capabilities that allow engineers to focus on how end products work instead of
how to use software to design them."
Joint Customers Benefit from Partnership
Joint customers such as Tonnard Manufacturing in Corry, Pennsylvania,
benefit from the long-standing partnership.  Short production runs, frequently
for prototypes, predominate Tonnard's workload, and short-run form tooling has
been a Tonnard specialty for decades.
Most form tools at Tonnard -- and every tool machined on the company's
Haas machines -- are designed in Autodesk Inventor.  "Every short-run job
seems to come down to the cost of tooling that will be used to make just a few
hundred or a few thousand parts. EdgeCAM's interoperability with Autodesk
Inventor lets us set up machining quickly, and was a leading reason for our
software choice," said Aaron Harwood, programming manager for Tonnard.
Tonnard finds the combination of Haas machines, EdgeCAM and Autodesk
Inventor contribute to its competitive advantage, and help keep manufacturing
in the United States.
"Using EdgeCAM, Autodesk Inventor, and the Haas machines allows us to take
on tougher jobs," said Horwood.  "Customers prefer to deal with us for their
smaller production runs and they want us to take on some pretty difficult
jobs.  So the more complex tool that we can make, the more complex part we can
make, and the more we can do to serve our customers."
Horwood said, "Having accounts with large customers is great, but you
better have a strong list of small customers too.  EdgeCAM, Autodesk Inventor,
and Haas help us get them, and keep them."
