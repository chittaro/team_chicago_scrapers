Autodesk has been integrating operations workflows into our software and services so customers can better understand the real-world performance of designs.
Solutions including Autodesk Tandem, AutoCAD, Revit, and Autodesk Construction Cloud support operational processes such as space planning or maintenance, while Autodesk’s solutions for the water industry—Info360 Insight and Info360 Asset—help make the operations of water assets more effective.
Strategic alliances with Eptura and Esri help fuel our support for the full architecture, engineering, construction and operations (AECO) industry.
By integrating operations workflows into Autodesk software and services, we aim to bridge the gap across the entire project lifecycle.
A project doesn’t end when residents move into a new building, cars traverse a bridge for the first time, or a train travels through a brand-new tunnel. Years of operations follow, and the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry requires a true focus on the entire project lifecycle. Simply put, it’s more than just AEC now.
Autodesk has been central to delivering the solutions that enable the AEC industry’s digital transformation. With our continued evolution, our commitment is to the entire ecosystem of architecture, engineering, construction, and operations (AECO) stakeholders.
By integrating operations workflows into our software and services, we aim to bridge the gap between project completion and more efficient and sustainable management of assets.
The importance of operations
In the traditional AEC model, the focus often ends once the building is constructed. However, a significant part of a building’s lifecycle happens post-construction, during its operation. By including operations in our model, we ensure that our software and services contribute to the efficient management and maintenance of buildings.
Broadening operation solutions
Our decision to include operations as a focus stems from our commitment to holistic project lifecycle management and aligns with the Autodesk Design and Make Platform to create more efficient, sustainable, and innovative solutions for the built environment. By focusing on the operations phase, customers can better understand the real-world performance of designs, leading to improved design strategies and data exchange and more efficient cost management practices.
AECO also reflects our continued broadening of operations solutions and capabilities. This includes Autodesk Tandem, AutoCAD, Revit, and Autodesk Construction Cloud–all of which support operational processes such as space planning or maintenance. In addition, our solutions for the water industry–Info360 Insight and Info360 Asset—help make the operations of water assets more effective.
Bringing in partners further fuels our move to AECO. Autodesk’s focus across the broader AECO ecosystem includes alliances with Eptura and Esri. Our
partnership with Eptura
began with integrations between Revit and Archibus, streamlining the connection between critical design and engineering data for building operations. In 2021, Autodesk made a strategic investment in Eptura, deepening our relationship.
Nick Stefanidakis, head of strategic alliances for Eptura said, “Combining AEC design and asset information with operational and performance data and workflows to improve the comfort, safety, and efficiency of building facilities has never been more important. Our strategic alliance with Autodesk allows us to deliver the solutions organizations need to meet this demand.”
Our
strategic relationship with Esri
helps bridge design workflows and location intelligence, providing industry and city planners the ability to design in the context of the real world and deliver more connected, resilient cities and infrastructure with an eye on sustainability. Autodesk’s hydraulic modeling and cloud technologies for water include robust integrations with Esri’s ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online. These integrations provide water professionals with the geospatial context to effectively plan, model, operate, and maintain their infrastructure.
As we continue our own transformation, we look forward to the new opportunities and outcomes it will bring for us, our customers, and the AECO industry as a whole.
