I am trying to understand the best practices for sharing product data within Vault with companies/partners/suppliers/co-developers outside our company. At present, the only method I can find is to 'pack' the some or all of product data (meta data, assembly & parts, drawings, and all other relevant data) and send it to the recipient. Or send them a bunch of URL to the CAD data. And when there is an update to the data that has been (released &) shared, then do this all over again.
On the recipient's side, they have to 'unpack' the data and load it into their system. We have a few scenarios here:
1. The recipient has Vault+Inventor - they may be able to take the data 'as is' with very little massaging to get into their system.
2. The recipient has PDM/PLM/CAD from another vendor - they have to find a way to "import" the data into their system, and this may lead to some data being neither imported into their PLM system or their CAD system.
3. The recipient has only CAD system - they have to grab the CAD data out of the 'pack' and use it, perhaps after translating it into their native CAD system, if they arent using Inventor.
And all of them have to this over again the moment something changes at the sending end to either the metadata or the CAD data.
I would like to know if the user community has evolved a set of best practices for each scenario. I would appreciate if people can share their thoughts on how they would deal with this situation in their company.

That is a big question.
If you have a project based setup of your folders in Vault you might want to look into Buzzsaw Project sync. You can sync folders with a cloud folder and give access to your external partners.

Thanks Gilsdorf, I already checked out Buzzsaw project. It works if everyone on the project is working on Vault+Inventor.
Its not a very optimal solution for our co-developers/design partners/suppliers who have already standardized on another PLM+CAD. All they want is access to the our data (in their own PLM+CAD format) without burdening our IT department to give the data everytime there has been a change at our end. Obviously they are not going to install Vault or Inventor just to use our data in their own work. And since we have 100+ suppliers, we need another way to keep all these folks up-to-date on the data that we are sharing with them. As of now, we are only talking about sharing our data with our suppliers, not the other way around - so there is really no need for 'collaboration'.
