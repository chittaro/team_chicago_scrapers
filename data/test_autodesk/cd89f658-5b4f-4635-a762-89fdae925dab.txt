So I got the email that Autodesk has finally cut resellers out of reselling Autocad and all products.
Does not apply to gov and EBA customers apparently. Gotta keep those gravy train deals going.
Makes me wonder, if its such a better experience, why is it only us schmucks that get it?
Any bets on how much the price will increase?
Think that reseller profit margin will be removed since they are cut out?
If you answer that, I welcome you to the Autodesk world, new customers are wonderful.

For now, it looks like (to me) they're only cutting out the middlemen for billing/payment. My guess is there will still be commissions sent to resellers (who are now or will be soon called "partners" or "affiliates" or something), but the money goes to Autodesk first. It guarantees they get their money, and gives the bonus of earning interest before sending out the checks.
I do see this as another step toward cutting out resellers altogether. Previously we had the change to named-user licensing and a big price increase. The resellers were there to deflect a large portion of the backlash.
I've seen this before in other verticals, and the language being used is like it's coming out of a standard playbook. Each step will have the logic of "improving customer experience" and be just enough to cause some grumbling for a little while. Rinse and repeat, and in 5-10 years, there will no longer be a reseller/partner program.

Yah, so shopping for pricing is no longer a thing.
I'm wondering when they stop deals for previous customers and we all pay rental like we were just born.

Being a reseller is like being a band member on the "Titanic"
