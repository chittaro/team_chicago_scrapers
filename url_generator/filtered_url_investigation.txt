Option 1 blacklist

adds a filtering function to screen out irrelevent, blacklisted or low-quality URLSs 
after extracting them from OpenAI, but before saving or returning them 

what this adds:
This option filters out the URLs that we wouldnt want and allows us to actually be able 
to customize this option of what to keep and what not to keep by just updating the blacklists
and then it will still use the OpenAI assistant as the discovery tool but this could be a hybrid 
control approach that we manually process what urls to consider

Option 2: Heuristic URL Scoring System

Isntead of filtering URLs with boolean checks we can actually assign URL a relevance score. 
The benefit to this is that Fabrizio could set and see a set of factors that would affect the 
scoring of the URLs and decide whether to keep or not keep. Or this could also be used to train the OpenAI

its more flexible and intelligent and removes the risk of missing url because it didnt have a certain
exact word that we werent looking from. its also a possibility to weight the factors and fine-tune over time
